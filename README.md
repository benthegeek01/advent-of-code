# What is this?
Just a fun repo I will maintain as best as I can. Advent of code is a great way
of practicing skills in various languages.   
## Languages
At time of writing, only Python is present. If I ever get around to doing it in
other languages (I probably should) then I will edit the directory structure to
have sub-directories in each year - one per language.
